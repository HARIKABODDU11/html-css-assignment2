        <section class="column1 "><img src="img/images10.jpeg " alt="img " />Victoria Falls presents a splendid view of the grandeur of Zambezi River which forms a border between two African nations- Zimbabwe and Zambia. Imagine yourself falling from the sky, passing through the rainbows, feeling the humongous sprays of water from the fall and landing near Zambezi River.</section>
        <section class="column1 "><img src="img/images11.jpeg " alt="img " /> Home to many of Earth’s highest peaks, the Himalayas offer adventure opportunities, picturesque sights and incredible tourism options. No wonder that the Himalayas is the origin place of the gushing rivers and also the preferred dwelling place of exotic species of flora and fauna. <br></section>
        <section class="column1 "><img src="img/images12.jpeg " alt="img ">The Maldives has a benign climate, with year-round temperatures between 79F and 86F (26C-30C). It never suffers from tornadoes though it does have a monsoon season in November which is best avoided and unsettled weather can persist well into December,
           though then the rain tends to be in short, afternoon bursts only.</section>
        <section class="column2 ">The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle.  </section>
